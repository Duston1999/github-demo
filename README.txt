An introduction to Git using IntelliJ CE!

Git allows version control of whatever you check in. 
It is especially useful for code repositories because it makes it easier to share code, review code, save code, and (probably) most importantly, revert code.

One can version control anything! 

While you can use Git in the command line, I feel like IntelliJ is more approachable and easier to visualize what is happening. 
Either approach is acceptable, and (most) anything you can do in the command line, you can do in IntelliJ.

## Installation Requirements (optional)
 - [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
 - [IntelliJ CE](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download) 
    - Make sure the Git plugin is enabled. In the Settings/Preferences dialog (âŒ˜,), select Version Control | Git in the left pane and specify the path to the Git executable.
 - Create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/)
    - Requires an email

- Why do we use it?
    - Here's some applications of open source development with specific libraries: https://dzone.com/articles/20-useful-open-source-libraries-for-java-programme
- What makes it relevant for enterprise development versus side projects?


## Demo in IntelliJ

## Try it yourself
[Here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/using-git-integration.html) is IntelliJ's documentation of their Git plugin.


[Here](https://git-scm.com/docs) is the official Git documentation. This is where you'll look for any questions on commands via terminal.

Check out this repo and try these out:
1. Git clone this repo
2. Create your own branch in the repo
3. Commit your first file to your branch
4. Push your file
5. Create a pull request
